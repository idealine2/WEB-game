            <h1>How the game works</h1>
            <p>
                The aim of the game is to get 4 circles of your colour in a row by stacking them in the different columns.
                This can be horizontal, vertical and diagonally up  and down.
                Once a column is filled, no more circles ca be added on top.
                The game ends once a player achieves this, making them the winner.
