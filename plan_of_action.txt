Welcome to the amazing plan of action (a draft)

>> willen we dat er een 'confirm move' message/knop is? Mss wel nice

A list of UI things?
- leaving game - can be done whether it's user's turn or not. 
    - Mouse click on button > give box asking them for confirmation 
        > yes = go to splash screen and end game
        > no = go back to game screen
- choosing a column for your circle
    - mouse click on column or above it
    > if column is full show message that that column is not a viable option
    > if possible > circle will go down to be in that column
